significant and often rapid fluctuations in product demand which could impact TSMC s semiconductor foundry business Variations in customer order levels may result in volatility in the Company s revenue and earnings From time to time the electronics and semiconductor industries have experienced significant and occasionally prolonged periods of downturns and overcapacity Because TSMC is and will continue to be dependent on the demand of electronics and semiconductor companies for its services periods of downturns and overcapacity in the general electronics and semiconductor industries could lead to reduced demand for overall semiconductor foundry services including TSMC s services If TSMC is not able take appropriate actions such as reducing its costs to sufficiently offset declines in demand the Company s revenue margins and earnings will likely suffer during periods of downturns and overcapacity Changes in Technology The semiconductor industry and its technologies are constantly changing TSMC competes by developing process technologies using increasingly advanced nodes and manufacturing products with more functions The Company also competes by developing new derivative technologies If TSMC does not anticipate these changes in technologies and rapidly develop new and innovative technologies or if the Company s competitors unforeseeably gain sudden access to additional technologies TSMC may not be able to provide foundry services on competitive terms For example the global surge in the development of artificial intelligence AI has had a significant impact on customer demand for advanced semiconductor chips and the market dynamics in TSMC s industry thus TSMC s ability to continuously develop relevant technologies products and services to meet these customer needs will be critical for the Company to effectively compete in this space TSMC also believes that the effective use of AI in its internal operations is important to its long term success

negative impacts on its business?,7e46e19c-e3d9-4f4e-92a4-d66dc50bd6b3,142 143due to increased competitive pressures industry consolidation changes in applicable regulatory restrictions product designs manufacturing sourcing or outsourcing policies or practices of these customers the timing of customer inventory adjustments or changes in its major customers business models may adversely affect TSMC s results of operations and financial condition Risks Associated with Purchasing Concentration Raw Materials TSMC s production operations require that it obtain adequate supplies of raw materials such as silicon wafers gases chemicals and photoresist on a timely basis and at commercially reasonable prices In the past shortages in the supply of some materials whether by specific suppliers or by the semiconductor industry generally have resulted in occasional industry wide price adjustments and delivery delays Moreover major natural disasters trade barriers and political or economic turmoil including military conflicts and inflation occurring within the country of origin of such raw materials may also significantly disrupt the availability of such raw materials or increase their prices Also since TSMC procures some of its raw materials from sole sourced suppliers there is a risk that the Company s needs for such raw materials may not be met or that back up supplies may not be readily available Importation and domestic production limitations may also limit the Company s ability to obtain adequate supplies of raw materials as well as materials of the necessary quality In addition recent trade tensions could result in increased prices or even unavailability of raw materials due to tariffs export control or other non tariff barriers TSMC s revenue and earnings could decline if it is unable to obtain adequate supplies of the necessary raw materials in a timely manner or if there are significant increases in the costs of raw materials To reduce the supply chain risk and to manage costs effectively TSMC commits resources toward developing new supply sources and developing a future capacity plan with qualified raw material suppliers Furthermore the Company continually encourages its suppliers to reduce their supply chain risk by decentralizing production plants to improve their cost competitiveness and to support TSMC global demands in a timely fashion TSMC not only operates world class manufacturing process and facilities but needs sufficient world class high quality raw materials As a result TSMC engages early and extensively with primary suppliers on managing quality and capacity issues so as to be prepared for any unexpected need to ramp up or curtail production To streamline supply chain risk the Company communicates early on with major material suppliers regarding quality and capacity topics and has formed a dedicated team for supplier plant onsite or remote audits to extend supply chain best practices to its upstream suppliers In addition in response to the rapid increase or decrease in production capacity of new products TSMC has continued to improve its inventory monitoring system to achieve more accurate demand forecasts and ensure that the supply chain maintains sufficient inventory levels The Company also performs supply chain risk assessments to ensure that critical suppliers meet various standards in labor ethics environmental safety and health ESH practices and business continuity plans BCPs Equipment The Company s operations and ongoing expansion plans depend on its ability to obtain necessary equipment and related services available from a limited number of suppliers As a result TSMC may encounter the situation of limited supply and or long delivery cycles To better manage its supply chain the Company evaluates and projects delivery lead times to minimize the impact of supply chain risks on operating costs TSMC has also implemented various collaborative business models and risk management contingencies with suppliers to ensure supply and shorten the procurement lead time To enhance its sourcing capabilities for its global sites the company has also taken steps to strengthen its understanding of local regulations policies and supply chains However if TSMC is unable to acquire in a timely manner the equipment and parts it needs it may fail to successfully implement capacity expansion plans and exploit time sensitive business opportunities Additionally ongoing trade tensions could result in increased prices for or even unavailability of key equipment through delay or denial of necessary export licenses adoption of additional export control measures and other tariff or non tariff barriers If TSMC is unable to obtain equipment in a timely fashion to fulfill its customers demand for technology and production capacity or unable to do so at a reasonable cost its financial condition and results of operations could be negatively impacted
